# ### Problem 6
# Create a class called ClubMember
# Each club member has a name and a role
class ClubMember:
    def __init__(self, name, role):
        self.name = name
        self.role = role
# Create ClubMember instances for the following people:
# ```
# Alfred - Club President
# Troy - Club Vice President
# Albert - Club Secretary
# Bob - Club Treasurer
# ```

member1 = ClubMember("Alfred", "Club President")
member2 = ClubMember("Troy", "Club Vice President")
member3 = ClubMember("Albert", "Club Secretary")
member4 = ClubMember("Bob", "Club Treasurer")
# Add each member instance to a new club_members list that you create.
club_members = [member1, member2, member3, member4]
# Write the code needed to loop through the club member list and print the current number of members in the list, then the memberâ€™s name and club role, one per line using f strings.

print("There are currently " + str(len(club_members)) + " club members in the list!\n")

for eachElement in club_members:
    print(f"{eachElement.role}: {eachElement.name}")
# Example Output:
# ```
# There are currently 4 club members in the list!

# Club President: Alfred
# Club Vice President: Troy
# Club Secretary: Albert
# Club Treasurer: Bob
# ```
